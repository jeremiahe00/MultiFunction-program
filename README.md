# MultiFunction-program

Program that contains multiple functions, implemented for practicing purposes (beginner/intermediate level)

## Description

This program was implemented to contain many functions to show variety of implementing methods
for those mostly on the beginner/intermediate level. This program was made for learning purposes
 and will/can be improved upon, given time.
 
## Implementation

Implemented in C++ on Microsoft Visual Studio

## Functions

- add2Nom() : adds two integer numbers
- encryptWord() : encrypts a word using specific encryption style
- calcGlassCost() : uses set width function and performs calculations
- productName_Price() : uses set precision function and calculates with discount
- largestInt() : grabs 3 numbers from user and outputs largest integer
- calcTemp() : based on input (C or F) converts the temperature
- sum_N_Noms() : grabs N number of integers and outputs the sum
- sum_Avg_IO() : grabs numbers from a file and calculates and outputs its average to another file
- char_IO() : grabs lines of words from a file and outputs the number of charcters in each line to the window
- balance_Loop() : checks user balance ($10 budget for online music store) and continuously checks for balance left using while loop
- doWhile_Mark() : checks if user inputs a correct letter for their mark/grade
- switch_Grade() : uses switch statements and outputs comment corresponding to grade 
- printStars() : prints a triangle of stars, starting with highest number of stars in the first line
- calc_PH() : calculates PH level of a concentration entered by user (0 to quit)
- calc_Avg_Sem() : Calculates average of user in a semester (uses a label)
 
avg(int) : calculates average
- metPowPro() : computes metabolic power of mammals/reptiles (uses variety of functions)
 
getData(double &, double &, double &, double &, double &, double &) : gets user data
 
calcVOC(double, double, double, double &) : calculates volume of oxygen consumed
 
calcSTP(double, double, double) : corrects voc to standard temperature and pressure
 
calcMP(double, double) : calculates metabolic power
 
PrintMetPower(double, double, double, double, double, double, double) : prints information and MP of animal
- order_OneDArray() : performs functions on one dimensional array
 
getArrayInput(int []) : gets array integers from user
 
printAsc(int []) : prints array in ascending order
 
printDesc(int []) : prints array in descending order
 
printSum(int []) : prints sum of the array integers

## Getting Started

Run program on MVS and either grab ".txt" files provided in this GIT repository, or create your own.

## Future Work

If you wish to push requests to add on to this program, or advanced modifications, feel free to do so.
I will be working on other repositories but may come back to this one to modify it and make it much more efficient.
